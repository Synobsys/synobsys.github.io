# Domain naming

The following rules apply to naming domains:

* Domain names are written in **plain English** (There are no specific OutSystems naming restrictions).
* Max length of domain names is **50 characters**.
* Vertical domains have a **meaningful business name**. E.g.:
    * `Soccer Fields`,
    * `Movies`
* Horizontal domains have a meaningful name, which may be more technical. E.g.:
    * `Identity`,
    * `Back-end Style Guide`
* Define an acronym for each domain. E.g. Soccer Fields :`SF`
