JMeter may be used for load testing. Since OutSystems applications are standard web applications, any strategy or tool currently used to test traditional web apps can apply. OutSystems recommends the following webinars explaining how to implement simple load testing scenarios using the open-source tool JMeter, for both web and mobile applications (server-side only):
