# Variable naming conventions

The following rules apply to all types of variables:

* Variable names are in PascalCase
* The name must be self explanatory and express the usage

## Input variables

* no rules yet

## Local variables

* **Constants** Local variables used as constants (i.e. have a fixed, default value that is not supposed to be changed over their lifetime) have a meaningful name, prefixed by the word **Const** (e.g. **ConstPollingInterval**)

## Output variables

* no rules yet
