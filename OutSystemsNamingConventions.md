## Language

    TODO Issue #4 ADR and Template for Common Glossary1

* All OutSystems code (Service Studio and Integration Studio), including comments and documentation will be in English. [ADR-002](adr\ADR-002-standard-language-is-English.md)
* Business terms in the OutSystems model will be in English and be taken from the **Common Glossary**.

* All UI in the OutSystems model will be developed in English and may be translated using the standard OutSystems localization features if required.
* Objects in the OutSystems environment have meaningful, unabbreviated names. Where naming limits prevent this (most OutSystems element names have a limit of 50 characters), standard abbreviations as provided in the **Common Glossary** must be used.
