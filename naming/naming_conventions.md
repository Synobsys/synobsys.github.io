# OutSystems Naming Conventions

## Language

* All OutSystems code (Service Studio and Integration Studio), including comments and documentation will be in English. [ADR-002](adr\ADR-002-standard-language-is-English.html)
* Business terms in the OutSystems model will be in English and be taken from the [Common Glossary](/common-glossary-template.md) [ADR-008](/adr/ADR-008-common-glossary.md).

* All UI in the OutSystems model will be developed in English and may be translated using the standard OutSystems localization features if required.
* Objects in the OutSystems environment have meaningful, unabbreviated names. Where naming limits prevent this (most OutSystems element names have a limit of 50 characters), standard abbreviations as provided in the **Common Glossary** must be used.
